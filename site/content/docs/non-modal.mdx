title: Non-Modal Mode
description: Sheets without overlay, focus trap, or scroll lock.
---

import { NonModalDemo } from "@/components/demos/non-modal-demo";

Set `modal: false` to open sheets that don't block page interaction. The page behind remains fully usable — no overlay, no focus trap, no scroll lock.

<NonModalDemo />

## Usage

```tsx
createStacksheet({ modal: false });
```

## Modal vs non-modal

| Behavior | Modal (default) | Non-modal |
|---|---|---|
| Backdrop overlay | Shown | Skipped |
| Focus trap | Active | Inactive |
| Scroll lock | Active | Inactive |
| `aria-modal` | `"true"` | Not set |
| Escape key | Closes (if `closeOnEscape`) | Closes (if `closeOnEscape`) |
| Drag to dismiss | Works | Works |
| `role="dialog"` | Set on top panel | Set on top panel |

## Use cases

- **Sidebars** — persistent navigation that doesn't block content
- **Auxiliary panels** — inspector or property panels alongside the main view
- **Notification trays** — slide-in notification lists
- **Tool palettes** — floating tool panels in creative apps

## Combining with other options

`showOverlay` is automatically skipped in non-modal mode — you don't need to set it to `false`.

Scroll lock (`lockScroll`) is also skipped automatically.

Drag to dismiss, escape key, and all other behaviors work the same as modal mode.

```tsx
// These are equivalent in non-modal mode
createStacksheet({ modal: false });
createStacksheet({ modal: false, showOverlay: false, lockScroll: false });
```
