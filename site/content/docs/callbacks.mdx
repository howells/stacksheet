import { StackingDemo } from "@/components/demos/stacking-demo";

## Overview

Stacksheet provides two animation callbacks for timing side effects to the animation lifecycle. Pass them in the config:

```tsx
const { StacksheetProvider, useSheet } = createStacksheet({
  onOpenComplete: () => {
    console.log("Top panel entrance animation finished");
  },
  onCloseComplete: () => {
    console.log("Stack fully closed, all exit animations done");
  },
});
```

<StackingDemo />

## onOpenComplete

Fires once when the **top panel's entrance animation** completes. It fires per panel entrance — when you push a new sheet, `onOpenComplete` fires again once the new sheet settles.

### Use cases

- **Auto-focus an input** after the sheet finishes sliding in
- **Start a timer** or trigger a lazy data fetch
- **Analytics** — track when a sheet becomes visible

### Behavior details

- Fires once per panel entrance (uses an internal `hasEnteredRef` flag)
- Resets when a panel is no longer on top (pushed down by a new sheet)
- Fires again when the panel returns to the top (via pop)
- Does not fire during exit animations

## onCloseComplete

Fires when the **last panel's exit animation** completes — meaning the stack is fully closed and all exit animations have finished.

### Use cases

- **Clean up state** after the sheet stack is dismissed
- **Trigger navigation** after a confirmation sheet closes
- **Analytics** — track sheet session duration

### Behavior details

- Only fires when `stack.length === 0` (all sheets have exited)
- Powered by `<AnimatePresence onExitComplete>` on the panel container
- Does not fire when popping a single sheet from a multi-sheet stack
