## Focus management

### Focus trap

The top panel is wrapped in a focus trap via `focus-trap-react`. This means:

- **Tab** cycles through focusable elements within the panel
- Focus cannot escape to the page behind the sheet
- `allowOutsideClick: true` allows backdrop clicks to close the sheet

### Focus restoration

When the sheet stack opens, Stacksheet captures `document.activeElement` (the trigger element). When the stack fully closes, focus returns to that element automatically.

For stacked sheets, each level handles its own focus restoration via `focus-trap-react`'s `returnFocusOnDeactivate` — popping a sheet returns focus to the element that was focused in the sheet below.

### Fallback focus

If no focusable elements exist inside a panel, the panel container itself (which has `tabIndex={-1}`) receives focus as a fallback. This ensures the focus trap always has a target.

## Keyboard navigation

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| **Escape** | Pops the top sheet. If it's the last one, closes the stack. |
| **Tab** | Cycles through focusable elements in the top panel |
| **Shift+Tab** | Cycles backward through focusable elements |

Escape behavior can be disabled with `closeOnEscape: false`:

```tsx
createStacksheet({ closeOnEscape: false });
```

## ARIA attributes

The top panel gets `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`. Sheets below the top have these attributes removed.

### aria-label

Configure the dialog's accessible name:

```tsx
// Global default
createStacksheet({ ariaLabel: "Settings panel" });
```

Per-sheet override via the `__ariaLabel` prop:

```tsx
// Component-direct pattern
open(UserProfile, { userId: "abc", __ariaLabel: "User profile for John" });

// Type registry pattern
open("user-profile", "user-1", {
  userId: "abc",
  __ariaLabel: "User profile for John",
});
```

The per-sheet label takes priority over the global config.

## Composable mode

In [composable mode](/docs/composable-parts) (`renderHeader={false}`), the panel uses `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` instead of `aria-label`. These are automatically linked to `Sheet.Title` and `Sheet.Description` via matching IDs.

If you omit `Sheet.Title`, the panel won't have an accessible name. Always include one, even if visually hidden.

## Non-modal mode

In [non-modal mode](/docs/non-modal) (`modal: false`):

- `aria-modal` is **not** set on the panel
- `role="dialog"` is still set on the top panel
- Focus trap is **inactive** — the user can Tab to elements behind the sheet
- Scroll lock is inactive

This is appropriate for sidebars and auxiliary panels where blocking page interaction would be undesirable.

## Scroll lock

When the sheet stack is open, body scroll is locked using `react-remove-scroll`. This library handles scrollbar width compensation automatically — no layout shift when the scrollbar disappears.

Disable with `lockScroll: false`:

```tsx
createStacksheet({ lockScroll: false });
```
